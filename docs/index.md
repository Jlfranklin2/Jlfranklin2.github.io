Hello! My name is Jaylan Franklin, I am currently a Student-Athlete with the University of the Wisconsin Badgers

 **Hobbies & Interests**
I have enjoyed playing sports since i was a kid, being active was a major focal point in my family, it kept my 2 brothers and I out of trouble, but it also developed us to be mature and professional at a veey young age!

  **Daily Activities**
Being an athlete it's no surprise that my days usually consists of excercise and sweating, but one passion a lot of people may not know about my family and I is that we are avid gamers! Competition didnt end on the field and court for us, we even loved comepeting in the cyberspace as well.
